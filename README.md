# Employee Tracker

## Description
This back-end application allows a user to manipulate an employee database. This project was created to give the user more control over their employee database and the ability to interact with that data in a simple manner. 

## Installation
In order to utilize this application, the user will need to install all node packages. They will also need to input their mysql username and password on lines 14 and 15 of the server.js file. 

## Usage
To begin, the user will have to open the integrated terminal and use node to open the server.js file.

From there, the user will receive a prompt for seven different options. When selecting a course of action that will affect the data in the database, further questions will be asked of the user.

When the user has completed all questions, they will either see a table showing the results of their queries or will be notified that the changes they'd requested have been made.
